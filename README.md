# UniSQ - SSAT
This folder contains the R code for the R Shiny application **Sesame Suitability Assessment Tool** (http://ssat.net.au/). Username and password: baci. SSAT, hosted on ARDC Nectar Research Cloud, leverages simulations generated by the new APSIM-Sesame model to assess the suitability of land and climate conditions for sesame cultivation across Australia. SSAT empowers users to conduct both spatial and point-based analyses across a grid of 101 locations encompassing the period 1981-2023. 

# UniSQ - Short-Term Forecast for Irrigation Management
This folder contains the R code used in and the visualisation prepared for the research paper titled "Evaluating the impact of weather forecasts on productivity and environmental footprint of irrigated maize production systems" published in Science of The Total Environment ([link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969724065240)). This study combines a crop model with a stochastic pseudo-weather forecast algorithm to: (1) determine the reliability needed in a weather forecast algorithm for effective irrigation management; and (2) assess the impact of weather forecast reliability on the productivity and environmental footprint of various maize cropping systems across diverse climates. It employs the Next Generation of Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM NextGen) to simulate maize growth at eleven locations representing diverse climates globally. Various planting schedules, soil types, irrigation systems, and nitrogen availability levels were considered to examine the effects of perfect and imperfect weather forecasts.

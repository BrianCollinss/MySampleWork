# UniSQ - SSAT
This folder contains the R code for the R Shiny application **Sesame Suitability Assessment Tool** (http://ssat.net.au/). Username and password: baci. SSAT, hosted on ARDC Nectar Research Cloud, leverages simulations generated by the new APSIM-Sesame model to assess the suitability of land and climate conditions for sesame cultivation across Australia. SSAT empowers users to conduct both spatial and point-based analyses across a grid of 101 locations encompassing the period 1981-2023. 

# UniSQ - Short-Term Forecast for Irrigation Management
This folder contains the R code used in and the visualisation prepared for the research paper titled "Evaluating the impact of weather forecasts on productivity and environmental footprint of irrigated maize production systems" published in Science of The Total Environment ([link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969724065240)). This study combines a crop model with a stochastic pseudo-weather forecast algorithm to: (1) determine the reliability needed in a weather forecast algorithm for effective irrigation management; and (2) assess the impact of weather forecast reliability on the productivity and environmental footprint of various maize cropping systems across diverse climates. It employs the Next Generation of Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM NextGen) to simulate maize growth at eleven locations representing diverse climates globally. Various planting schedules, soil types, irrigation systems, and nitrogen availability levels were considered to examine the effects of perfect and imperfect weather forecasts. 

# UQ - Compound Dry-Hot Extremes
This folder contains the R code used in and the visualisation prepared for the research paper titled "Frequency of compound hot–dry weather extremes has significantly increased in Australia since 1889" published in Journal of Agronomy and Crop Science ([link]([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969724065240](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jac.12545))). Daily data spanning the period 1889-2019 (131 years) were extracted from SILO gridded dataset at 700 grid cells (1◦ × 1◦) across Australia to calculate annual and seasonal mean daily maximum temperature (MMT) and total precipitation (TPR). A nonparametric multivariate copula framework was adopted to estimate the return period of compound hot-dry (CHD) events based on an ‘And’ hazard scenario (hotter than a threshold ‘And’ drier than a threshold). CHD extremes were defined as years with joint return periods of longer than 25 years calculated over the period 1889-2019. Mann-Kendall nonparametric tests were used to analyse trends in MMT and TPR as well as in the frequency of univariate and CHD extremes.
